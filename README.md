# med_web_fb

i have add a model based on our teammate's backend code part
the adding part in code:
#add part
unet_model.save("unet_model.h5")
print("Model saved as unet_model.h5.")

we already have a model, but is too big to upload, so i deliver the link right to the model.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E1gKSMryRGkH478c7Q12vLAcurD5pyMM/view?usp=drive_link

Make sure model is in the same directory as the main program

after install the necessary Library
1. shift + right click to open the PowerShell(windows)
2. then enter"python app.py"
3. go to the  http://127.0.0.1:8080 showing on PowerShell
